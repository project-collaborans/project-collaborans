## Why This Structure?

**GitHub Discussions:**
- Forum-like, conversational
- Good for community building
- Less formal, easier to browse
- Great for ideas and questions

**GitHub Issues:**
- Trackable, actionable
- Clear status (open/closed)
- Can be assigned and prioritized
- Better for things needing follow-up

**Both are public and transparent** - aligning with our governance values.

## Labels Guide

See [LABELS.md](LABELS.md) for full explanation of our label system.

Common labels you'll see:

- `conduct-report` - CoC violations
- `governance` - Governance discussions
- `technical` - Technical issues

## Response Times

**Discussions:**

We'll handle these with appropriate discretion while maintaining accountability.

GitHub will remain primary for transparency and documentation.
