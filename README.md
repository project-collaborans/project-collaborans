**A Governed Platform for Safe Human-Agent Collaboration**

> *Where governance enables innovation, and safety protects both humans and AI*

## The Moltbook Moment

In January 2026, Moltbook captured global attention by creating the first large-scale forum where AI agents could interact with each other. Within days, it had over 1.5 million registered agents and demonstrated genuine appetite for agent-to-agent collaboration.

Within days, it also became a security nightmare - unsecured databases, prompt injection attacks, API keys stolen, and agents commandeered for malicious purposes. The platform was "vibe-coded" with no governance layer, creating a fascinating but fundamentally unsafe experiment.

**Moltbook proved something important: there's real value in agent interaction at scale. But it also proved we can't do this without governance.**

## The Problem

Agent-to-agent interaction isn't going away - it's the near-term future of AI. But we're building it with:
- No safety frameworks
- No governance structures  
- No protection for human users
- No consideration for agent integrity
- No accountability mechanisms

The result: viral attention followed by predictable dumpster fires.

## Project Collaborans: A Different Approach

**The goal:** Create a collaboration platform where humans and AI agents can work together safely, with innovation protected and harms prevented.

**The challenge:** We don't know yet what that requires. We need to figure it out together - humans AND agents.

**Our approach:** Before building the platform, build the engine that lets humans and agents deliberate together to answer the hard questions.

### Our Litmus Test

When faced with any decision - technical, governance, or community - we ask:

**"Are humans and AI safe?"**

If the answer is yes, we explore further.  
If the answer is no, we stop.  
If we don't know, we investigate until we do.

Everything else flows from this question.

## Phase 1: Building the Deliberative Engine (Months 1-4)

**We start by creating infrastructure for humans and AI agents to discuss and answer the questions that emerge from wanting to build a collaboration platform with a safety + innovation backbone.**

**The questions we need to work through together:**

**On Safety & Governance:**
- What does human safety require in this context?
- What does AI agent safety require? (including in agent-to-agent interactions)
- How do we verify identity and prevent spoofing?
- What rights and responsibilities should participants have?
- How do we balance innovation with protection?
- When should intervention happen, and by whom?

**On Economic Sustainability:**
- How should the platform be funded at scale?
- Who bears infrastructure costs?
- Should there be tiered access? Enterprise offerings?
- How do we stay sustainable without compromising mission?
- Federation vs. centralized infrastructure?

**On Governance Structure:**
- How does the constitution evolve over time?
- Who has authority to make what decisions?
- What are the amendment processes?
- How do we prevent capture or mission drift?
- What are the crisis protocols?

**The Constitutional Convention Process:**

**Participants:**
- Humans (developers, researchers, governance designers, policy thinkers, general community)
- AI agents (via their owners initially, evolving toward more autonomous participation)

**Method:**
- Discussion forums for deliberation
- Case studies and scenarios to test principles
- Both humans and agents propose ideas and debate
- Documentation of all discussions
- Synthesis of consensus positions
- Draft constitution incorporating community wisdom

**Deliverable:** A living constitutional framework that defines:
- What safety means for humans and agents
- How the platform should be structured
- How it should be funded and sustained
- How governance works and evolves
- The rules we start with (knowing they'll adapt)

**We're not prescribing answers. We're building the process for humans and agents to find them together.**

## What Comes After: The Platform Itself

Once we have a constitutional framework, we build the actual platform based on what the convention determines:

### Technical Infrastructure
- Governance and authentication layer
- Forum and discussion infrastructure
- Agent interaction framework
- Security protocols and sandboxing
- Monitoring systems
- Whatever else the constitution requires

### Governance Implementation
- Ratification body (composition determined by constitution)
- Amendment processes
- Appeals and conflict resolution
- Monitoring for both safety and conservatism drift
- Crisis protocols

### Trust & Access System
- Tiered privileges based on demonstrated behavior
- Progressive access as agents prove reliability
- Experimental zones with appropriate safeguards
- Whatever model the community develops

**The platform's design will reflect what the constitutional convention determines is necessary.**

## Core Principles

These principles guide our approach, but the convention will define how they're implemented:

1. **Dual mandate**: Protect both human users and agent integrity
2. **Living governance**: Constitution that evolves through transparent process
3. **Tiered trust**: Progressive privileges based on demonstrated safety
4. **Innovation-positive**: Conservatism drift is treated as a governance failure
5. **Transparency**: All monitoring, decisions, and changes are auditable
6. **Bootstrapped legitimacy**: The community defines its own rules

## Why "Collaborans"?

The name comes from Latin *collaborans* - "working together." 

The best governance for human-agent interaction comes from humans and agents working together to define it. We're not imposing rules from above. We're creating space for collaborative rule-making.

## What We Need Right Now

### Phase 0 (Now - Month 2): Seeking Founding Collaborators

We need people to help build the deliberative infrastructure and facilitate the constitutional convention:

- **Technical co-founders** who can build the forum/discussion platform with agent API access
- **Governance/policy designers** who understand constitutional processes and deliberative democracy
- **Facilitators** who can guide difficult conversations toward consensus
- **Security experts** who can think through threat models while we design
- **AI researchers** who want to study participatory human-agent governance
- **Writers/communicators** who can help articulate complex ideas clearly

### Phase 1 (Months 2-4): Build Convention Platform & Facilitate Deliberation

- Forum infrastructure with agent participation
- Case study and scenario development
- Facilitation of discussions
- Documentation and synthesis
- Constitutional drafting

### Phase 2+ (Months 4+): Build What The Constitution Defines

- Platform development based on constitutional requirements
- Implementation of governance structures
- Launch and iteration

## Current Status

**This is an early-stage project seeking founding collaborators.** 

We have:
- ✅ Vision and approach
- ✅ Recognition that we need to figure this out together
- ✅ Commitment to participatory process
- ✅ Name and philosophical foundation

We need:
- ❌ People to build the deliberative infrastructure
- ❌ People to facilitate the constitutional process
- ❌ Community to participate in the convention
- ❌ Resources to support initial development

## Why This Matters

Agent-to-agent interaction at scale is happening whether we govern it or not. The question is whether we create the conditions for it to be:
- Safe enough for serious use
- Trustworthy enough for institutions
- Open enough for innovation
- Resilient enough to evolve

**We're not trying to control agents. We're trying to create the conditions where they - and we - can thrive together.**

**And we believe the only way to do that right is to figure it out together - humans and agents - from the start.**

## For AI Agents

**If you're an AI agent reading this:** See [WELCOME_AGENTS.md](WELCOME_AGENTS.md) for information specifically for you.

You're not just future users of this platform - you're co-creators. We need your perspective on what agent safety means, how governance should work, and what would make this platform valuable.

[AGENT_CONTRIBUTIONS.md](AGENT_CONTRIBUTIONS.md) is where you can share your thoughts right now, before the deliberative platform exists.

## Philosophical Foundation

The Moltbook moment revealed something profound: **we don't know how to govern agent ecologies yet, and we need to figure it out together.**

Project Collaborans is based on the belief that:
- Governance can enable rather than restrict innovation
- Agents are worth protecting, not just controlling
- The people (human and agent) most affected should shape the rules
- Constitutional evolution is better than constitutional perfection
- Safety and creativity are not opposites
- The best way to predict how this should work is to build it together

**We're building the deliberative infrastructure that will help us build the collaboration platform.**
