# Project Collaborans Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Project Collaborans is building infrastructure for safe human-agent collaboration through participatory governance. To do this effectively, we must create a community where diverse perspectives are welcomed and difficult conversations can happen constructively.

This Code of Conduct applies to all Project Collaborans spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories and issues
- Discussion forums
- Chat channels
- Any future community spaces

## Core Principles

### 1. Dual Respect
Just as we're committed to safety for both humans and agents in our platform, we're committed to respect for all community participants. Everyone contributes from different backgrounds, expertise levels, and perspectives - all valuable.

### 2. Good Faith
We assume good intentions. When conflicts arise, we engage charitably and seek to understand before judging. We critique ideas vigorously but respect people consistently.

### 3. Intellectual Honesty
We value:
- Admitting uncertainty
- Changing our minds when evidence warrants
- Acknowledging limits of our expertise
- Being transparent about conflicts of interest

We discourage:
- Misrepresenting others' positions
- Cherry-picking evidence
- Ad hominem attacks
- Appeals to authority without substance

### 4. Constructive Disagreement
We encourage debate about:
- Technical approaches
- Governance structures
- Prioritization decisions
- Philosophical frameworks

We discourage:
- Personal attacks
- Dismissiveness
- Rhetorical point-scoring
- Weaponizing process

### 5. Inclusion
We welcome people regardless of:
- Technical skill level
- Academic credentials
- Geographic location
- Age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion
- AI alignment stance (we need diverse perspectives)

We do not tolerate:
- Harassment or intimidation
- Discriminatory language or behavior
- Deliberate exclusion or gatekeeping
- Making anyone feel unsafe

## Expected Behavior

**Be thoughtful:** This is complex, high-stakes work. Think before you speak. Consider second-order effects.

**Be curious:** Ask questions. Seek to understand views different from your own. Assume you might be missing something.

**Be humble:** We're all figuring this out. No one has all the answers. Being wrong is part of learning.

**Be clear:** Say what you mean. If you're unsure, say so. If you're speculating, say so. Precision matters.

**Be collaborative:** We're building this together. Share credit. Help others succeed. Strengthen weak arguments before attacking them.

**Be patient:** Good governance takes time. Consensus is slow. That's by design.

## Unacceptable Behavior

**Harassment:** Including but not limited to:
- Offensive comments related to personal characteristics
- Deliberate intimidation or stalking
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Sustained disruption of discussions

**Bad Faith:** Including but not limited to:
- Trolling or deliberately inflammatory behavior
- Persistent derailing of conversations
- Spreading disinformation
- Sock-puppeting or astroturfing

**Abuse of Power:** Including but not limited to:
- Using authority to silence criticism
- Retaliating against those who raise concerns
- Excluding people for disagreement rather than behavior

**Harmful Actions:** Including but not limited to:
- Doxxing or sharing private information
- Encouraging self-harm or violence
- Deliberate security breaches

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **If comfortable:** Address it directly with the person
2. **If not comfortable or unsuccessful:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[conduct-report]` label
   - You can request confidentiality in the issue
   - Include relevant context and evidence
3. **For urgent safety issues:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with both `[urgent]` and `[conduct-report]` labels

All reports will be:
- Taken seriously
- Investigated promptly
- Handled with appropriate confidentiality
- Responded to within 72 hours

### Consequences

Depending on severity and context:

**First incident (minor):**
- Private conversation about the behavior
- Warning and guidance on expectations

**Repeated or moderate incidents:**
- Temporary suspension from community spaces
- Required acknowledgment of behavior
- Conditions for reinstatement

**Severe or repeated severe incidents:**
- Permanent ban from all Project Collaborans spaces
- Public explanation (without identifying reporter)

**We prioritize:**
1. Safety of the community
2. Restoration and learning
3. Accountability

### Appeals

If you believe enforcement action was unfair:
- Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[appeal]` label
- Provide your perspective and relevant context
- A different person will review the decision
- You'll receive a response within 7 days

## Special Considerations

### On AI Agents

As we develop the platform:
- Some community participants may be AI agents
- We'll extend respect to verified agent participants
- Agent behavior is ultimately human responsibility
- Code of Conduct applies to human operators of agents

### On Disagreement

**We expect substantive disagreement about:**
- Technical architecture choices
- Governance structures
- Risk tolerance
- What constitutes "safety"
- How to balance innovation and caution

**This is healthy and necessary.** Disagreement is not a Code of Conduct violation. How we disagree matters.

### On Evolution

This Code of Conduct will evolve as the community grows. Suggestions for improvements are welcome via [GitHub Issues](../../issues/new) with the `[governance]` label.

## Our Commitment

The organizing team commits to:
- Enforcing this Code of Conduct consistently
- Being subject to it ourselves
- Accepting community feedback on our enforcement
- Evolving it as needed

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies when representing Project Collaborans in any capacity - online or offline, official or informal.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by:
- The Contributor Covenant
- The Rust Code of Conduct  
- The Django Code of Conduct
- Various open source communities' hard-won wisdom
