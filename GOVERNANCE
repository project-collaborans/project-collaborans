# Project Collaborans Governance

## Current Organizational Status

**Legal Status:** Unincorporated open source project  
**Phase:** 0 (Seeking founding collaborators)  
**Governance:** Bootstrap / Forming

## Our Governance Philosophy

Project Collaborans exists to build governed infrastructure for human-agent collaboration. We believe governance should be:
- **Participatory** - Those affected help make the rules
- **Transparent** - Decisions and reasoning are public
- **Adaptive** - Rules evolve as we learn
- **Legitimate** - Authority derives from community consent

**We practice what we preach.** The governance structures we're building for the platform will eventually govern the project itself.

## Bootstrap Phase Governance (Current)

While we're forming the initial team, decision-making works like this:

### Strategic Direction
**Who Decides:** Vision keeper  
**What This Covers:** 
- Core mission and values
- Major pivots or direction changes
- What problems we're solving and why
- Organizational structure decisions

**How It Works:**
- Proposals shared via [GitHub Issues](../../issues)
- Community discussion period (minimum 7 days)
- Final decision documented publicly with reasoning
- Can be challenged if misaligned with stated mission

### Technical Architecture
**Who Decides:** Founding technical team (once formed)  
**What This Covers:**
- Platform architecture choices
- Technology stack
- Security approach
- Implementation decisions

**How It Works:**
- Proposals in [GitHub Issues](../../issues) or technical docs
- Review by other technical team members
- Community feedback welcome
- Decisions documented in architecture docs
- Must align with safety-first principle

### Community Management
**Who Decides:** Community moderators (as we grow)  
**What This Covers:**
- Code of Conduct enforcement
- Conflict resolution
- Community space management

**How It Works:**
- Code of Conduct establishes expectations
- Moderators handle violations
- Appeals process available
- Quarterly review of enforcement patterns

### Resource Allocation
**Who Decides:** Core team consensus (once formed)  
**What This Covers:**
- How donations/grants are spent
- Who gets paid (if anyone)
- Infrastructure costs

**How It Works:**
- Transparent budget
- Decisions by consensus
- Community can object to misalignment with mission

## Transition to Constitutional Governance

As the project matures, governance will transition to the structures we're building:

### Phase 1: Constitutional Convention
**Timeline:** Months 2-4  
**Process:**
- Community deliberates on governance questions
- Both humans and agents participate in discussions
- Synthesize into draft constitution
- Community reviews and refines
- Ratification process

**This constitution will define:**
- How the platform is governed
- Protection mechanisms for humans and agents
- Governance of agent-to-agent interactions
- How decisions are made
- Who has authority over what
- How governance evolves

### Phase 2: Ratification Body Formation
**Timeline:** Month 4-5  
**Process:**
- Constitution defines ratification body composition
- Initial body selected per constitutional process
- Project governance transitions to constitutional model

### Phase 3: Steady State
**Timeline:** Month 6+  
**Structure:**
- Project governed by its own constitution
- Ratification body makes governance decisions
- Community can propose amendments
- Regular governance reviews

## Organizational Structure (Future)

### Target Structure: Non-Profit Foundation

**Why:**
- Mission protection
- Can't be captured or sold
- Tax-deductible donations
- Grant eligible
- Public benefit mandate

**Timeline:** Incorporate when we have:
- Working platform
- Active community
- Regular costs that need organizational structure
- Need for legal entity

**Process:**
- Community discussion on incorporation
- Draft foundation bylaws
- Align with constitution
- File incorporation
- Elect initial board

### Potential Subsidiary: Public Benefit Corporation

**Why:**
- If commercial operations needed
- Can raise capital
- Can pay competitive salaries
- Mission still protected

**When:** Only if:
- Clear need for commercial operations
- Non-profit can't meet operational needs
- Community supports via constitutional process

**Structure:**
- Foundation owns controlling stake in PBC
- Mission can't be overridden for profit
- Transparent operations

## Intellectual Property

**Current:**
- All code: AGPL-3.0
- All documentation: CC-BY-SA 4.0
- Owned by contributors collectively

**Future:**
- IP assigned to foundation
- Licenses remain open
- Mission-aligned use only

## Financial Transparency

**Current:**
- No income, no expenses
- Any donations tracked publicly

**Future:**
- Public budget
- Quarterly financial reports
- Clear expense categories
- Compensation policy (if any)

## Decision-Making Principles

Regardless of phase, all decisions should:

1. **Align with mission:** Does this support safe human-agent collaboration?
2. **Preserve openness:** Does this keep the platform open and participatory?
3. **Build trust:** Is this transparent and explainable?
4. **Enable evolution:** Does this allow us to adapt as we learn?

If a decision fails these tests, it needs more discussion.

## Conflicts of Interest

**Disclosure Required:**
- Employment by relevant companies
- Financial interests in related projects
- Personal relationships affecting judgment
- Any other material conflicts

**Process:**
- Disclose conflicts publicly via [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with `[governance]` label
- Recuse from decisions where conflicted
- Document disclosure in decision records

## Amendment Process

**Current:** This governance document can be updated by:
1. Proposal via [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with `[governance]` label
2. Minimum 14-day discussion period
3. Decision by vision keeper with community input
4. Changes documented with reasoning

**Future:** Once constitution is ratified, that governs amendment of this document.
