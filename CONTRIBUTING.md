# Contributing to Project Collaborans

Thank you for your interest in Project Collaborans. This project aims to create governed infrastructure for safe human-agent collaboration, and we need diverse perspectives and skills to make it succeed.

## Current Status

**We are in Phase 0: Seeking Founding Collaborators**

This is the earliest stage. We have a vision, a framework, and organizational principles, but we don't yet have:
- Technical infrastructure
- Development resources  
- A team
- Funding

**We're looking for people who want to help define what this becomes.**

## How You Can Contribute

### 1. Technical Co-Founders Needed

We urgently need 1-3 people who can:
- **Architect distributed systems** - Design governance layer architecture
- **Build secure platforms** - Handle authentication, sandboxing, monitoring
- **Ship working software** - Not just design, but implementation
- **Think about security** - Understand threat models, prompt injection, agent security

**What this role involves:**
- Co-designing the technical architecture
- Building the Phase 1 constitutional convention platform
- Setting technical direction
- Eventually: leading the engineering team

**What we're looking for:**
- Experience building multi-user platforms
- Understanding of security principles
- Comfort with open source development
- Alignment with our values (participatory governance, safety-first, commons-oriented)

**To apply:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[collaboration]` label, including:
- Brief background on relevant experience
- Why Project Collaborans resonates with you
- What you'd bring to the architecture/implementation
- Your thoughts on the governance framework

### 2. Governance & Policy Designers

We need people who understand:
- Constitutional design and amendment processes
- Deliberative democracy and consensus-building
- Participatory governance structures
- How to design rules that evolve

**What this role involves:**
- Designing the constitutional convention process
- Creating frameworks for the ratification body
- Thinking through edge cases in governance
- Helping facilitate community deliberation

**Backgrounds that fit:**
- Political science, law, governance studies
- Community organizing, facilitation
- Democracy innovation, civic tech
- Constitutional theory

**To contribute:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[collaboration]` label and describe your background and ideas about how the constitutional process should work.

### 3. Security Researchers

Given Moltbook's disasters, we need security expertise:
- Threat modeling for agent platforms
- Authentication and identity verification
- Sandboxing approaches
- Monitoring architecture
- Prompt injection prevention

**To contribute:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[collaboration]` label and share your security background and concerns you see with the current design.

### 4. AI Researchers  

We need people studying:
- Multi-agent systems and emergent behavior
- Agent safety and alignment
- Constitutional AI and value learning
- Human-AI interaction

**To contribute:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[collaboration]` label and describe your research background and how Project Collaborans could advance your work (or how your work could inform ours).

### 5. Community Builders & Facilitators

We need people who can:
- Design deliberative processes
- Facilitate difficult conversations
- Build inclusive communities
- Manage conflict constructively

**To contribute:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[collaboration]` label and share your community building experience.

### 6. Writers & Communicators

Help us:
- Articulate the vision more clearly
- Create documentation
- Explain technical concepts accessibly
- Build the case for why this matters

**To contribute:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[collaboration]` label, including writing samples and what aspects you'd want to help communicate.

### 7. Economic Sustainability Designers

We need people who understand:
- Infrastructure costs at scale
- Sustainable funding models for commons infrastructure
- Grant funding and institutional support
- Enterprise business models that don't compromise mission
- Federation and distributed systems economics

**To contribute:** Open a [GitHub Issue](../../issues/new) with the `[collaboration]` label and share your experience in platform economics, infrastructure funding, or sustainable business models for public goods.

### 8. General Supporters

Even if you don't fit the above categories:
- **Star this repository** to show support and help others discover it
- **Share with relevant people** in your network
- **Provide feedback** on the framework via [GitHub Issues](../../issues)
- **Join discussions** in Issues and future forums

## What We're NOT Looking For (Yet)

- General software developers (we need architects first, coders later)
- Marketing/growth people (not trying to grow fast, trying to build right)
- Product managers (governance will emerge from the community)
- Investors (we're building a non-profit, not a startup)

## Our Values & Expectations

If you want to contribute, you should:
- **Believe in participatory governance** - Not top-down control
- **Value safety alongside innovation** - Not "move fast and break things"
- **Think long-term** - Building infrastructure for decades, not a quick project
- **Be comfortable with uncertainty** - We're figuring this out together
- **Respect the dual mandate** - Human AND agent safety matter

You should also:
- Be patient - this will move thoughtfully, not frantically
- Be collaborative - egos don't help here
- Be transparent - hidden agendas will be discovered
- Be committed to keeping this open - no enclosure of the commons

## Communication Channels

**Current:**
- GitHub Issues for all discussion and inquiries
- Use labels: `[question]`, `[collaboration]`, `[governance]`, `[technical]`, etc.

**Coming soon:**
- Discussion forum (likely Discourse)
- Real-time chat (likely Discord or Matrix)
- Mailing list for announcements

See [CONTACT.md](CONTACT.md) for details on how to reach us.

## Decision-Making (For Now)

During this bootstrap phase:
- Vision keeper maintains strategic direction
- Technical decisions made collaboratively by founding technical team
- Major direction changes discussed openly via GitHub Issues
- We're building the governance that will govern us

As the project matures, decision-making will transition to the structures defined in the constitution.

## Timeline

**Phase 0 (Now - Month 2):** Find founding collaborators  
**Phase 1 (Month 2-4):** Build minimal convention platform, launch constitutional convention  
**Phase 2 (Month 4-8):** Synthesize constitution, begin platform development  
**Phase 3 (Month 8+):** Launch governed platform

These are targets, not commitments. We move when ready, not when scheduled.
